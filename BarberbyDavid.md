# Barber by David

This customer happens to be my barber and reached out to me when he messed up whilst editing his website.
When editing the layout that was a complete mess, which I regret not print screening just to have a "before and after", I asked him if he'd be interested in a complete overhaul.
He was interested and the project proceeded. This was my first chance/project to be published to the web.

The only thing kept from before is the CMS being **WIX**, texts he wrote himself and built-in components, such as "booking" or "contact-form".
That aside, I built the website from the ground up.


### Things of note:
- I have adviced him on multiple occassions to have a photographer take new pictures for him, as the quality of current images are very subpar.

- This website's layout primarily targets the phone user experience, since **92%** of its traffic originates from phones.

### The limitations of WIX as a CMS
- WIX was at the time of creating this website, *very* limited in responsivity. This made margins and padding very inconsistent between devices and screen sizes.
The only two options are "phone" and "monitor". Which often makes everything inbetween look strange.

- Some things, such as text color in menus are hard coded towards the theme and cannot be manually edited or coded.

- Given these limitations, I have adviced him to change to a different CMS, like Shopify. A CMS he's familiar with.
But he's hesitant to this change, and doesn't see a reason behind it as he's fully booked one week ahead of time, most of the time.

I have glimpsed through the documentation. But this is just the way things are, it seems.
But even then - He's really happy with the result. He got to stick to his comfort-zone being WIX, being the booking system and client contact - remaining intact.
He even wants me to create business cards for him to give out in his shop, which makes me happy as it is a genuine review in itself.
